# population_growth_simulator
 
### Description:
This C program simulates population growth over the years based on user input for the initial and target population sizes. The simulation takes into account birth and death rates, updating the population annually until the target population is reached.

### Usage:
Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc population_growth_simulator.c -o population_growth_simulator).
Run the compiled program (./population_growth_simulator).
Enter the initial population size (must be 9 or greater).
Enter the target population size (must be greater than the initial population).

### Notes:
The program ensures valid input for both the initial and target population sizes.
The simulation calculates population growth based on birth and death rates.
### Future Enhancements:
Allow users to customize birth and death rates.
Provide additional statistics and graphs for a more detailed simulation.
